DATA ANALYSIS OF AMAZON’S DATASET

Senem Yalın - Almira Gürkan

ABSTRACT

Data mining is the process of automatically discovering useful information in large
data repositories. We are drowning in data, but starving for knowledge. Natural language
processing (NLP) is an exciting branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows machines to
break down and understand human language. In this assignment, we used NLP techniques to
interpret text data that we are working with, for our analysis. In addition, Recommendation
System and Neural Network are used for prediction.
